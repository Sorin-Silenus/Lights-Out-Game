#Lights Out

Hey! Who turned out the lights?

## Lights Out
Lights Out was a handheld game in the days of Lisa's childhood. You can play it online here: [https://www.logicgamesonline.com/lightsout/](https://www.logicgamesonline.com/lightsout/).

### Base Game
In its simplest form, the 5x5 grid of lights begins with all of the lights lit. When you click on one of the lights, it toggles itself and the (up to) four lights it borders.

Here's a gif of the beginning of the game, where the lights have a red outline hover effect:

When you make all the lights go off, you win the game and can no longer click on the lights:

For testing purposes, here are the lights you need to click to get from a fully lit start to a fully unlit end:
